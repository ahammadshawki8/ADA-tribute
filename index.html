            <h1>Story of Ada Lovelace</h1>
            <p>
                Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was born into a historically famous family. There was no shortage of his father’s
                fame and his mother’s money. With all this, he could spend his whole life in luxury. But instead, she
                decided to write computational computer algorithms, which led to her being dubbed the "mother of
                programming." He became the first computer programmer in the mid-nineteenth century. He was the first to
                think about how to make the calculation work more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just a few weeks after Lovelace's birth, her father, the famous poet Lord Byron, left her and her mother,
                Lady Ann Isabella. While Lord Byron was gaining remarkable fame throughout Europe, Lady Ann developed her
                daughter, Ada Lovelace, as an independent and modern woman. Lady Ann hired a renowned
                teacher to teach her daughter Ada about mathematics, science, social structures, medical systems, and astronomy.
                Lovelace's mother hoped that these detailed studies would protect her daughter from developing the serious
                and undesirable character of her father, Lord Byron. Ada Lovelace showed interest in every subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of her mother, Ada became interested in science and mathematics from an early age. First, he was
                incredibly interested in the objects flying in the sky, and he watched the birds closely. He even created a
                guide called "Flyology" with the help of his own drawings. In later life, he became interested in the
                opposite attitudes of his parents and wrote an essay on the "relationship between imagination and
                practicality." His most influential writings, however, were published in 1833, when he attended a ceremony
                and met his next teacher there.

                This tutor was none other than Charles Babbage himself, known as the father of computers. She caught the
                attention of Ada Loveles. The two quickly became friends because of the same mentality, and Babbage showed
                Lovelace his plan for an analytical engine designed to calculate more complex equations than his first
                computational machine. He introduced the idea of ​​"programming" to use Babbage's analytical engine. In
                1842, Babbage spoke at the University of Turin about his engine. During this time, Ada described the working
                style of the engine with a full speech with the help of Babbage. He described it step by step while
                describing the work style. Also because of their close relationship, Babbage commissioned Ada Lovelace to
                translate an article about Babbage's composition from French into English.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ada Lovelace did the job very efficiently, but more importantly, she added her own notes to the translation.
                As a result, the size of the article almost quadrupled. Among these notes was how to communicate with a
                machine using programming code. "Communication" here means writing letters and numbers by creating semantic
                letters on a machine. And to do this he describes the steps of creating a looping process that programmers
                still use worldwide today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lovelace received many posthumous awards for his contributions to computer programming. The United States
                Department of Defense has also named a programming language 'ADA' in his honor.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to an article in the New York Times: “There are a lot of developers, programmers and scientists
                around the world involved in computer programming today. Ada Lovelace's role in the development of this
                large technology sector in the world is immense. Computer technology has come to this advanced stage as a
                result of the combination of Lovelace's inventions while acquiring Babbage technical skills. He was the
                first person to see the true potential in computer programming. Maybe that's why Babbage called her <i>Lady
                Fairy</i>."
